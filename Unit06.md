**Unit 6: Oxygen Transport And Transfer** <span id="6"></span> 
*Oxygen is essential to many life forms, including human life.  Many
human-body functions at the cellular level require oxygen; accordingly,
oxygen must be transported through the body and transferred to the
biological entity that requires it.  In this unit, you will learn about
the metal centers in the activation sites of proteins that are involved
in the transport and transfer of oxygen in the human body.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9.5 hours to complete.  
    
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 8 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 0.5 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 0.5 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.4: 0.5 hour

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student should be able
to:  
-   Describe the basic mechanism of assisted oxygen transport into and
    removal of carbon dioxide from the human body.
-   Explain what is meant by *cooperativity* and how it assists in
    dioxygen transport in biological systems.
-   Compare and contrast the heme families in terms of oxygen transport
    and transfer.

     This reading discusses the three main classes of compounds for
    biological oxygen transport, both in oxygenated and deoxygenated
    forms.  Hemoglobin is iron-based; hemocyanin is di-copper based; and
    hemoerythrin is di-iron based.  As you read, pay particular
    attention to the properties of copper and iron that make them useful
    for oxygen transport.  
        
     Please note that this reading also covers the material you will
    need to know for subunits 6.2-6.4, found below.  When you reach
    those subunits, you may find it helpful to refer back to this
    reading to review specific topics.  
        
     This reading, including note-taking, should take you approximately
    8 hours to complete.
