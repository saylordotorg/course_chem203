**Unit 2: An Overview of Characterization Methods in Bioinorganic
Chemistry** <span id="2"></span> 
*The structures of the metal-containing residues in biological molecules
can be discovered by using a variety of spectroscopy methods and
techniques.  Methods used for structural elucidation, as well as
mechanistic studies, include: X-Ray crystallography; nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy; vibrational spectroscopies, such as
infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies; and electronic spectroscopies,
such as ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In this unit, you will review
the basic principles of these analytical techniques and explore their
application to inorganic biomolecules.*
