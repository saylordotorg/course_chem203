**Unit 8: Toxicology And Medical Applications** <span id="8"></span> 
*Several metal ions are essential to biological functions in humans, and
deficiencies in these ions can lead to serious adverse health effects. 
Yet, these same metal ions that are beneficial also can act as toxins to
biological organisms in higher doses or under different applications. 
However, when used in specific ways, some metals also have been utilized
in a variety of medical applications.  Medical applications of metal
ions range from diagnostic uses to therapeutic uses, including drug
delivery systems.  In this unit, you will examine both the necessity and
toxicity of certain metal ions.  You also will learn about some
therapeutic medical uses of these ions, such as their contribution to
anti-arthritic compounds and anti-cancer agents.  In addition, you will
explore some key medical diagnostic techniques that rely on metal ions,
such as MRI scans and nuclear imaging.  You will conclude this unit with
a look at some of the more recent developments in the medical
applications of metals, including the use of metals in antimicrobials,
which fight harmful bacteria and fungi; insulin-mimetics, which aim to
treat diabetes; and even antidepressants, for the treatment of mental
illness.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the online
    textbook.  Then, scroll down the webpage and click on the link for
    chapter 9 to open a PDF version of the chapter, which you should
    read in its entirety.  You may also choose to download a PDF of the
    entire book and then navigate to chapter 9, which begins on page
    505.   
        
     Throughout this course, we have discussed the biological
    significance of several metal ions, including copper, iron, and
    zinc.  For this subunit, focus in particular on sections II (“Metal
    Deficiency and Disease,” beginning on page 506) and III (“Toxic
    Effects of Metals,” beginning on page 508) of chapter 9 in the
    textbook.  This material describes what happens when you have too
    much or too little of these biologically important cations.  
        
     Please note that this reading also covers material you need to know
    for subunits 8.2-8.4, found below.  When you reach those subunits,
    you will receive further instructions for a targeted review of this
    reading.  
        
     This reading, including note-taking, should take you approximately
    8 hours to complete.

    version of the lecture slides.  Please read the slides in their
    entirety, but focus specifically on slides 6-9, beginning with “The
    biomedical periodic table” and ending with “Chemical
    Considerations.”  Notice that we are revisiting the concepts of
    oxidation states, ligand binding, and HSAB theory when we consider
    metal ions for medical uses.
