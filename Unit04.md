**Unit 4: Electron Transfer in Biological Systems** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Electrons are continuously supplied and removed during the course of
biological processes.  Because transition metals can take on multiple
oxidation states, they are particularly suitable for these
electron-transfer tasks.  The most common metal centers for
electron-transfer reactions are based on copper and iron cations.  Metal
ions also play an essential role in photosynthesis and other processes
in plant and algal systems.  In this unit, you will learn about the role
and importance of metal ions that are involved in the electron traffic
of biological systems – including, in particular, those that are crucial
to the processes of plant and algal systems.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the online
    textbook.  Then, scroll down the webpage and click on the link for
    chapter 6 to open a PDF version of the chapter, which you should
    read in its entirety.  You may also choose to download the PDF for
    the entire book and navigate to chapter 6, which begins on page
    315.  
        
     As you read, keep in mind that, in biological systems,*oxidation*
    refers to the addition of oxygen bonds or the removal of hydrogen,
    while *reduction* refers to a decrease in the number of bonds to
    oxygen or an increase in hydrogen.  Also consider the structural
    effects of biological molecules in terms of long-range and
    short-range electron transfer.  Note that this chapter also
    discusses the Marcus theory of electron transfer, beginning in
    section III, on page 336.  Marcus theory helps explain the
    probability of outer-sphere (long-range) and inner-sphere
    (short-range) electron transfer.
