This course will teach you the important role that metal ions play in
key biological processes.  You will learn that many biological functions
are performed at the cellular level by metal ions that are incorporated
into the activation sites of proteins and enzymes.  For example, when
oxygen is transported through blood in the human body, it is bound to
iron ions that are incorporated into the hemoglobin protein.  In order
to function properly, these iron ions must be high-spin and in their +2
oxidation state.  As you progress through this course, you will learn
about these and other requirements and mechanisms that must be present
in order to facilitate critical biological functions. You will begin
this course by reviewing the basic principles of inorganic chemistry,
biochemistry, and molecular biology.  Following a brief overview of the
spectroscopy methods that scientists use in the study of metals that
contain protein, you will explore the structures of the most relevant
metal centers in biological molecules, focusing in particular on
non-redox enzymes, electron-transfer copper-based and iron-based
proteins, nitrogen-fixation proteins, nitrification and denitrification
proteins, and oxygen-transporting proteins. This course will help you to
recognize the importance of inorganic molecules in supporting organic
biological systems.  As you progress through this course, you not only
will gain an understanding of some very complex macromolecules that rely
on metal centers; you also will gain insight into recent scientific
developments that utilize key metal ions for breakthrough medical
purposes.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student should be able
to:  

-   Demonstrate proficiency in the basic principles of inorganic
    chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology that are necessary to
    approach the field of bioinorganic chemistry.
-   Identify the appropriate analytical techniques that are useful in
    characterizing transition-metal complexes in biological molecules.
-   Describe the different processes involved in the transport and
    storage of metal ions.
-   Describe the role of metal ions that are involved in
    electron-transfer reactions in biological systems. 
-   Describe the most common metal centers for electron-transfer
    reactions—those based on copper and iron ions. 
-   Summarize the role of metal centers in the enzymes that are involved
    in the nitrogen cycle.
-   Describe how oxygen is transported through the human body and
    transferred to each biological entity that requires it; identify
    which metal centers perform these tasks.
-   Describe the different metal-activation sites in enzymes that are
    involved in the incorporation of oxygen atoms into bio-organic
    molecules.
-   Describe the functions of metals in plant- and algal-based systems.
-   List some of the historic and current medical applications of metal
    ions.

### Course Information

Welcome to CHEM203, Bioinorganic Chemistry.  Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course uses a range of different free,
online educational materials, including an online textbook, journal
articles, and course lecture notes.  The primary resources used in this
course are:  

-   CaltechAUTHORS Digital Archive: Dr. Ivano Bertini, Dr. Harry B.
    Gray, Dr. Stephen J. Lippard, and Dr. Joan Selverstone Valentine’s
    [*Bioinorganic
    Chemistry*](http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25052/) *(Mill
    Valley, CA: University Science Books, 1994)*
-   Wells College: Dr. Christopher T. Bailey’s [*Special Topics in
    Inorganic Chemistry: Bioinorganic
    Chemistry*](http://henry.wells.edu/~cbailey/bioinorganic/) Course
    Lecture Notes
-   The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay: Dr. R. Murugavel’s
    [*Inorganic
    Chemistry*](http://www.chem.iitb.ac.in/~rmv/old/ch103.htm) Lecture
    Notes
-   The University of Georgia: Center for Metalloenzyme Studies’ [*MRIL
    Biophysics Module*](http://cms.uga.edu/Biophy.html)
-   The University of Glasgow: Dr. Lee Cronin’s [*Metals in
    Medicine*](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/teaching.php) Lecture
    Notes

Due to the frequency with which the online textbook *Bioinorganic
Chemistry*, listed above, is used as a resource in this course, you may
wish to download the entire textbook PDF and save it to your desktop or
a folder on your personal computer for use as a quick reference as
needed.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned readings and
materials.  In addition, you will need to successfully pass the Final
Exam with a score of 70% or higher.  
    
 Please note that you will receive an official grade only on your Final
Exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to complete and review all the assigned materials in this course. 
It is therefore recommended that you take thorough notes as you work
through each assignment.  
    
 Your score on the Final Exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete
it.  If you do not pass the Final Exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **75 hours** to complete.  Each unit of this course
includes time advisories that list the amount of time you are expected
to spend on each subunit and assignment.  It may be useful for you to
take a look at these time advisories and determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then set goals
for yourself.  For example, unit 1 should take you approximately 9.5
hours to complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete subunits 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 (estimated at 2.5 hours)
on Monday night; subunit 1.4 (estimated at 6 hours) on Tuesday and
Wednesday nights, and so on.  Once you have worked through all the
course materials, be sure to factor in significant additional time for
reviewing your readings and notes before you attempt to take the Final
Exam.
