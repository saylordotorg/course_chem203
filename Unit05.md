**Unit 5: The Nitrogen Cycle: Nitrification, Denitrification, And
Fixation** <span id="5"></span> 
*The nitrogen element possesses a variety of potential oxidation
states.  It could be +3 in compounds such ammonia, -5 in the nitrate
ion, or any of the oxidation states in between.  In the nitrogen cycle,
nitrogen in the atmosphere enters the food chain through nitrogen-fixing
bacteria in the soil and algae in the water.  These bacteria then
transform molecular nitrogen into ammonium ions (an 8-electron-transfer
reaction!).  These ammonium ions subsequently are oxidized into
nitrites, and eventually these nitrites are oxidized into nitrates by
bacteria present in the soil and water.  Nitrates then are absorbed by
plants through their roots and are used to produce proteins, which can
in turn be disseminated through the food chain.  Nitrogen also is
released into the environment in various forms through the decomposition
of dead organisms and through human and animal waste that subsequently
are re-used by bacteria.  In this unit, you will learn about the
function of metal centers in the enzymes involved in the nitrogen
cycle.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 3.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.2: 0.5 hour   
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.3: 1 hour

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student should be able
to:  
-   Describe the nitrogen cycle, from uptake to the excretion of
    nitrogen-containing compounds.
-   Discuss the electron-transfer mechanisms involved in uptake and the
    incorporation that occurs during nitrogen fixation.
-   Identify the key enzymes involved in the nitrogen cycle, as well as
    their functions.

     This reading discusses the entire nitrogen cycle, including the
    processes of nitrification, denitrification, and nitrogen fixation. 
    The *nitrification* process converts ammonium to nitrate via a
    series of enzymatic steps; while *denitrification* involves a series
    of steps in which nitrate is reduced ultimately to N<sub>2</sub>. 
    This material also provides an explanation for why nitrogen must
    undergo the nitrogen-fixation process and cannot just be utilized as
    is from the atmosphere.  
        
     Please note that this reading also covers material you need to know
    for subunits 5.2 and 5.3, found below.  When you reach those
    subunits, you may find it helpful to refer back to this reading to
    review specific topics.  
            
     This reading, including note-taking, should take you approximately
    2 hours and 30 minutes to complete.

**5.2 Denitrification (Reductase)** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Note: The material you need to know for this subunit is covered in the
reading assigned beneath subunit 5.1, found above.  For this subunit,
focus on the reading’s description of the processes and enzymes that
convert nitrate into nitrogen or ammonia.  Spend approximately 30
minutes reviewing this material before moving on to the next subunit of
this course.*

**5.3 Nitrogen Fixation (Nitrogenase)** <span id="5.3"></span> 
*Note: Some of the material you need to know for this subunit is covered
in the reading assigned beneath subunit 5.1, found above—in particular,
the reading’s description of the metal clusters used in different
biological systems.  In addition, material pertaining specifically to
nitrogenases also has been covered in the readings assigned beneath
sub-units 4.3 and 4.3.4 of this course.  You may find it helpful to
refer back to this previous material as you complete the web media
assignment below.*

    (HTML and Java)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access and read all
    the material presented in the online tour of nitrogenase.  Please
    note that this tour requires Java to run; you may need to enable
    Java on your web browser or download a version of Java to your
    computer in order to complete this assignment.  
        
     This tour provides you with several models of the nitrogenase
    enzyme and its binding sites. Nitrogenase is actually composed of
    two enzymes, one Fe-based and the other FeMo-based.  These two
    enzymes work in tandem to transfer electrons.  Please proceed
    through the viewing exercise in order, reading the description for
    each of the models as you progress.   
        
     This web media assignment should take you approximately 1 hour to
    complete.
