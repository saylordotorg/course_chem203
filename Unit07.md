**Unit 7: The Enzymes And Proteins Used For Oxygen Processing** <span
id="7"></span> 
*Once oxygen is transported and transferred to the desired site, it
needs to be incorporated into bio-organic molecules.  This process
occurs via several chemical reactions, such as hydroxylations and
oxygenations.  Different enzymes catalyze these reactions, but they all
use metal ions in their activation centers.  In this unit, you will
learn about the structures and functions of the metals involved in these
processes.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 7.25 hours to complete.  
    
 ☐    Subunit 7.1: 6.5 hours        
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.2: 0.5 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.3: 0.25 hour

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student should be able
to:  
-   Describe how oxygen, once it has been transported by bioinorganic
    molecules, is incorporated into bio-organic molecules.
-   Identify the key metal-ion-containing enzymes that catalyze these
    processes.
-   Discuss oxygen toxicity and antioxidant enzyme activity.

**7.1 Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Bioinorganic Chemistry*: Dr. Joan Selverstone
    Valentine’s “Chapter 5: Dioxygen Reactions”**
    Link: *Bioinorganic Chemistry*: Dr. Joan Selverstone Valentine’s
    [“Chapter 5: Dioxygen
    Reactions”](http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25052/) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the online
    textbook.  Then, scroll down the webpage and click on the link for
    chapter 5 to open a PDF version of the chapter, which you should
    read in its entirety.  You may also choose to download a PDF of the
    entire book at the top of the webpage, and then navigate to chapter
    5, which begins on page 253.  
        
     In this reading you will discover that oxygen, essential for
    aerobic life, also can cause dioxygen toxicity in high
    concentrations.  Superoxide dismutase, catalases, and peroxidases
    work together to remove excess dioxygen as well as the unwanted side
    products of dioxygen reactions.  For this subunit, focus in
    particular on superoxide dismutase, or SOD, specifically covered in
    section VII of the textbook, on pages 298-310.  
        
     Please note that this reading also covers material you need to know
    for subunits 7.2-7.3, found below.  When you reach those subunits,
    you may find it helpful to refer back to this reading to review
    specific topics.  
        
     This reading, including note-taking, should take you approximately
    6 hours to complete.

-   **Reading: Wikipedia’s “Superoxide Dismutase”**
    Link: Wikipedia’s [“Superoxide
    Dismutase”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CHEM203_Wikipedia_Superoxide-Dismutase_12.20.12.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access and read the
    entire Wikipedia entry on superoxide dismutase.  This material gives
    you a relatively concise description of superoxide dismutase, or
    SOD, which can be Zn/Fe- based, Fe/Mn-based, or Ni-based, depending
    on the biological species in which it is present.  This topic is
    covered in more detail in [*Bioinorganic
    Chemistry*](http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25052/), the online
    textbook featured in this course.  If you find yourself struggling
    with understanding any of the material presented in this reading,
    you may find it helpful to refer back to page 191 from chapter 4 of
    the textbook, as well as pages 263, 265-266, and 298-305 from
    chapter 5.  
              
     This reading should take you approximately 30 minutes to
    complete.

**7.2 Catalase** <span id="7.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikipedia’s “Catalase”**
    Link: Wikipedia’s
    [“Catalase”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CHEM203_Wikipedia_Catalase_12.20.12.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access and read the
    entire Wikipedia entry, which gives you a relatively concise
    description of catalase.  Catalase is the iron-based enzyme
    responsible for the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, a harmful
    byproduct of several metabolic processes.  This topic is covered in
    more detail in [*Bioinorganic
    Chemistry*](http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25052/), the online
    textbook featured in this course.  If you find yourself struggling
    with understanding any of the material presented in this reading,
    you may find it helpful to refer back to page 191 from chapter 4 of
    the textbook, as well as pages 263 and 295-298 from chapter 5.

**7.3 Peroxidase** <span id="7.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikipedia’s “Peroxidase”**
    Link: Wikipedia’s
    [“Peroxidase”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CHEM203_Wikipedia_Peroxidase_12.20.12.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access and read the
    entire webpage.  This material gives you a general description of
    peroxidase.  Peroxidase is similar to catalase, since both are
    iron-based enzymes that break down hydrogen peroxide; however,
    peroxidases have a much more general substrate and can break down
    other types of biological peroxides as well.  This topic is covered
    in more detail in [*Bioinorganic
    Chemistry*](http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25052/), the online
    textbook featured in this course.  If you find yourself struggling
    with understanding any of the material in this reading, you may find
    it helpful to refer back to pages 263 and 295-298 from chapter 5 of
