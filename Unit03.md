**Unit 3: Metal Ion Transport and Storage** <span id="3"></span> 
*Transition-metal ions such as iron, copper, and zinc are essential
components of key biological molecules that exist within all living
organisms.  These metal ions are obtained by living organisms through
their diet and then are transported into and stored by cells until they
are needed for the synthesis of a particular protein or enzyme.  In this
unit of the course, you will explore this process of transportation and
storage in great detail.*
