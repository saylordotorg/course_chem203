**Unit 1: An Introduction To Bioinorganic Chemistry** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This introductory unit will provide you with the foundational tools
that you will need to understand new concepts developed later in this
course, regardless of your background in the field.  You will review
important ideas from inorganic chemistry and take a closer look at the
basic properties of enzymes, proteins, and peptides that you may have
learned about in other courses on biochemistry and molecular biology. 
As you progress through this unit, you will discover that many
biological molecules, from oxygen-transport proteins to enzymes, require
metal ions in order to function.  *
